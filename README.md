## Browser Requirements

This application requires a browser that supports the Web Bluetooth API:
- **Chrome 56+** (recommended)
- **Edge 79+**
- **Opera 43+**

**Note**: Firefox and Safari do not currently support Web Bluetooth API.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone or download** this repository
2. **Open `index.html`** in a supported browser
3. **Click "Connect Cube"** to pair with your GAN 356i Carry
4. **Start solving** - the timer can start automatically or manually
5. **Generate summary** for detailed analysis and coaching feedback

## How to Use

### Initial Setup
1. Ensure your GAN 356i Carry cube is charged and in pairing mode
2. Open the application in Chrome or Edge
3. Click "Connect Cube" and select your device from the browser dialog

### Recording Solves
1. **Automatic Mode**: Timer starts when you make the first move and stops when solved
2. **Manual Mode**: Use the timer controls to start/stop manually
3. **Edit Data**: Manually adjust any timing or move data as needed

### Getting AI Feedback
1. Complete a solve (automatically parsed or manually entered)
2. Click "Generate Summary" to create analysis text
3. Click "Copy to Clipboard" 
4. Paste into ChatGPT with a request like: "Please analyze this speedcube solve and provide improvement suggestions"

## Technical Architecture

### Core Modules

- **`gan-bluetooth.js`**: Handles Web Bluetooth API communication with GAN cube
- **`solve-parser.js`**: Analyzes move sequences to detect solve phases
- **`timer.js`**: Provides high-precision timing functionality
- **`app.js`**: Main application controller coordinating all modules

### Data Flow

1. **Cube Connection**: Establishes BLE connection and starts listening for data
2. **Move Detection**: Parses incoming move data and timestamps
3. **Phase Analysis**: Identifies Cross, F2L, OLL, and PLL phases
4. **Timer Coordination**: Syncs timing with cube state and moves
5. **Export Generation**: Creates formatted analysis for AI coaching

- **TX Characteristic**: `6e400003-b5a3-f393-e0a9-e50e24dcca9e` (notifications from cube)
- **RX Characteristic**: `6e400002-b5a3-f393-e0a9-e50e24dcca9e` (commands to cube)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Web Bluetooth not supported"**
- Use Chrome 56+, Edge 79+, or Opera 43+
- Ensure HTTPS connection (required for Web Bluetooth)

**"Cube not found"**
- Make sure cube is charged and awake
- Try shaking the cube to activate it
- Check that cube is not connected to another app

**"Connection lost"**
